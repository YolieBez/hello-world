# hello-world
My first repository 
I was never really interested in learning anything. Everything seemed boring. Until one day, when I was introduced to computer programming. I do not know much yet, it is a forever evolving world. However, I want to learn and evolve with this world. I also want to prove some people wrong, who don't think computer coding is for me.
